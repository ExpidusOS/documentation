# The Manual

## Introduction

This is the user orientated manual for ExpidusOS, it aims to provide information and help for most issues and features.
For users who need help with the internals, we suggest looking at the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org).
If there is something that is not covered by the manual, it is suggested to place an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExpidusOS/manual).

## Using the Manual

This manual reflects the current version of ExpidusOS, *0.1.1-prealpha*. Specific features and things noted here
may not apply to previous or later versions. It is heavily suggested to use the manual version which goes with the version you
are using. Another piece of important information to remember is this is for a pre-alpha version of ExpidusOS. This means components
in ExpidusOS may not be entirely stable. If you are experiencing any issues with any related components, please report them on the GitHub repository
listed for said component. If the component does not come with ExpidusOS, please report it with the ExpidusOS development team on any platform you can reach us on.
